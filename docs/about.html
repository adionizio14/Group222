        <h2>
            Our finance friend app we are designing is an independent tool to
            help people with managing their money, struggling or not.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            How we came up with this idea?<br />
            We came up with 5 obersvations when conducting a survey.
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most of the students who are in college are either unemployed or
                have a part time job, and at least half of them also have credit
                card payments to worry about.
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the questions asked in the survey was to ask users ways
                to come up with ways in which they can improve upon managing
                their money. From the over 50 responses we received there were
                common answers or similar answers that appeared. Some of these
                are making more money, having a saving goal and spending less
                overall or spending less on non-needs purchases.
            </li>
            <li>
                A majority of people who took the survey are between the ages of
                18-25 and of this age group, the average person of this age
                group would use an app like this.
            </li>
            <li>
                When asked how people manage their money for now, 1/5 of the
                survey answered that they do not use anything or simply
                "nothing".
            </li>
            <li>
                People who are more likely to use the app tend to be in college.
            </li>
        </ul>
