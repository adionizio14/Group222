*  Net Promoter Score - We would collect this metric by asking the user, via a pop up, after a certain amount of time if they would recommend using this app to other people. If the user says no, the timer will reset and they will be asked again after a certain amount of time using the app. If the user says yes, it will redirect them to a survey that asks how likey on a scale from 1-5 and after it is submitted, they will never ask again.
* User Activity - We could have a tracker on how many times this user has signed in along with the most recent login time and used the application. Using the Firebase metrics, we can see the activity of the user. We can add a counter to each user to show log-in amount and display these analytics to a user for consistent activity tracking. This will show the frequency of user activity for the application.  
* 7-Day Active Users - By recording how many times a returning user creates a weekly savings plan we can measure the task succession of the user. In firebase and google analytics we can see their activity towards saving plans. For example, if a user has been using the app for 8 weeks and 6 of those they have created a weekly savings plan, we can see they have a 75% task succession rate over the 7 day period. Additionally, this metric can then be scaled to over a larger period of time ( 14, 28 day active user span). This metric capture can determine if our app is useful and good for the general market. If task succession rate is lower than expected we can theorize new features to attract user rentention and task succession.  
* Number of saving plans created per month - Collection of this metric would be by how many times the savings plans are created in the month by the users. This shows how many users are using the app to start. The app will then be taking the amount they save by input which should gradually rise until the goal is met for that month. The combination of the creation and completion of the monthly goal would show the activity of the users over time.
* New User Sign-Up Rate - We would collect this metric by using a tracker to record all the users that have not signed up previously. This could be done using the new user registrations to see how many users sign up in a week using the firebase metrics. This will show the frequency of new users per week and how well we are encouraging users to adopt the app.
